# Ticketing_Tool
A ticketing tool for a university is a software program that allows students, faculty, and staff to submit requests or issues to the IT department or other support teams. These requests can include things like technical problems, facilities issues, or general inquiries. The tool tracks each request and assigns it to the appropriate team member for resolution. This helps to ensure that all requests are handled in a timely and efficient manner.
